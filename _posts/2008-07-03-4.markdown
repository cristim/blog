Hello,  
  
As part of [my GSoC project](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/coresystems/appinfo.html?csaid=ED0729A9DB64B39B), I'm working on a [coreboot](http://coreboot.org/) payload that contains a Linux kernel with [KVM](http://kvm.qumranet.com/) enabled, and a small userland that will contain KVM-qemu.  
  
Currently I only have the kernel and the userland without KVM-qemu, but I'm working on porting it to uClibc, which seems to lack some things present in glibc that KVM-qemu needs in order to compile and run.  
  
[Here](http://tower.utcluj.ro/%7Ecristi/bios_stuff.tar.bz2) you can find what I have by now. To run it, extract both of the .bin files to your home directory and run  


<blockquote>qemu -L ~ -hda /dev/null</blockquote>

The code can be seen at http://repo.or.cz/w/kvm-coreboot.git, but it's work in progress  
More to follow on this topic...
