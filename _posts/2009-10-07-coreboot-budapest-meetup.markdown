Yesterday I had a presentation in Budapest, at their [New Technology Meetup](http://newtech.meetup.com/42/).

It was a short introduction to the [coreboot](http://coreboot.org) project.  I saw some cool projects made by the other presenters and participants, like a Z80-based hand-made computer able to run Basic and a very spectacular DJ application full of graphic and sound effects.

I had a lot of fun, and I can say that it did worth all the effort of driving there and back in a single day for 15 hours or so (never trust a GPS device blindly, you can get into trouble!).  I only wish they didn't talk in Hungarian while presenting so that we could understand the discussions *hint*.

Thanks to the organizers, especially Balazs Fejes and Tamas Terray for inviting me.
