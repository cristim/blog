Hi,

It's been a long time since my previous post and many good things happened to me ever since. A few months ago I changed my job, moved to a new home, bought a bike, adopted a [lovely little cat](http://panzer.utcluj.ro/~alien/spuff/MVI_0070.AVI) and today I finally graduated my MSc studies.

Lately I've been working on the thesis project, and I'm very glad it's over. The project implemented a netinstall and configuration management system for a gLite cluster, all written in [Puppet](http://www.puppetlabs.com) and available [on my github page](http://github.com/cristim)

Now that I finished this I can finally spend more time watching Star Trek or hacking on coreboot :), I just got an old RTL8029AS NIC from an ex-colleague (Thanks Serban Cordis!) that I'll try to get working as a remote debug console in [Coreboot](http://coreboot.org) and [SerialICE](http://serialice.com) just like Rudolf Marek [did](http://blogs.coreboot.org/?s=8029) a while ago.

Cristi
