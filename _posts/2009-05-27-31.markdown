Hello,

After reading some articles on phoronix that revealed some benchmarks where the older generation kernel appeared quite slow compared to those >= 2.6.29, I decided to change my default linux kernel from the default 2.6.28 provided by Ubuntu 9.04, to 2.6.30-r7 from the Ubuntu ppa. I got amazed about its speed and responsiveness and I can only recommend it to anyone.

Cristi
